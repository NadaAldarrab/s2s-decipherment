For trembling of the heart
We have noticed that if you take a powder of red coral and saffron, and this is drunk in a fine wine, it will immediately stop trembling of the heart.
For boils and pains of the breasts

An important secret (in this context = panacea) for breast pains: application of mole skin is marvellous; if you have let the mole die while holding it in your hand with its eyes towards the sun, and with that same hand covered the ailing breast, the pain goes away. The wife of Hans Stoldis (?) suffered from boils in her breasts so badly, that she <almost> died, and he used a plaster made from <lac rani> - that is fat that floats on the surface of milk which has been left for some time – and common chalk; this was applied

and in a quarter of an hour the pain had been mitigated, and she could rest during the night (or 'the pain was not felt during the night'). He said that previously several <other plasters> had been used, without result. On the following day, camphor water and other emollients were used. An other tried remedy. Take fresh beeswax; of this, you make a cap, or cover, which covers the entire bust, and which is to be worn night and day, so that the breast inside might sweat; then (the state of) all boils are immediately mitigated; this loosens all scirrhi and nodules, and when there was an ulcer

Another remedy

River crayfish is boiled in wine and with pepper as usual. Their shells are removed, and the powder of those, taken twice every single day, cures every flux. From this remedy a certain captain in Burgundy gained much gold; he, however, mixed it with another powder which wouldn't be known.

A great secret preparation, which is the best remedy in dysentery and excessive menstrual bleeding, and tried.

Give pulverized tar, and when restriction is brought about you give onions, fried with good lard. I knew a man, who cured dysentery with a powder of partridges' feet in this way: He took feet of partridges, and dried them at slow fire in a new pot, in the oven, or otherwise

he gave the powder with some restringent decoction, e.g. of plantain [or] tormentil. And in all fluxes from the bowels he gave the meat and broth of ravens [and] deer [???] of crayfish

For dysentery

Mr Tucker distilled water of tormentil together with the herb, and gave to his son, who was, maybe, six weeks old, and suffered from dysentery,

in such a way, that food and drink immediately after being taken passed undigested through his intestines, so that he had no other cure, and immediately, after two or three doses, he regained health, after having already been mourned by his parents.

According to Andrea Dedoria (=Andrea Doria?)

Take of leaves of mullein as much as you wish; cut them very fine and fry them in oil, until it does no longer crackle, strain and keep for use. With this oil, the stomach is rubbed, and the pain immediately subsides.

and powder of root of tormentil is given twice or thrice, and he assures that every poisonous flux is compesced. And I think this is because of a capacity the tormentil has, to repel poisons; for there is a kind of flux which is called ”stools of the dead”, and when he for two days feared for flux of poisonous matter, I said to mr Michael that these stools are deadly, even if it pleases [him] that I hope to rid him of them; he answered that I should do what seemed

best, so I gave him one ounce of fried rhubarb in juice of plantain, and he evacuated his bowels thoroughly. On the following day I gave it again, and the poisonous flux stopped, and he lived afterwards for almost eight years.

For lientery

Take lentil meal and yolk; seeds of plantain, nutmeg: together it becomes a paste, and it is pasted on a beam above the hearth, and it should thus be given when hot, since when it cools, it hardens like a stone, which can no longer be chewed.

Ferment a nutmeg wrapped in dough, and when fermented it should be baked in the oven; keep it and eat it warm in the morning and evening. And you will see the result. In the same malady, drink swallows in red wine, twice or thrice a day, and the flux will stop.

Note

Experiment to see whether a dysenteric patient is going to die or not: touch the pulsating blood vessel in the left part of the foot; if you have felt a pulse in this part, there is hope, but if not,

The first chapter on oil of vitriol (=sulphuric acid; this entire chapter is based upon Valerius Cordus' Novum dispensatorium, page 381sqq in the 1627 Leyden ed./UÖ)
Oil of vitriol, which by some is called oleum vitae (i.e. 'oil of life'), or melancholia artificialis (i.e. 'artificial black bile'), is nothing else than the alum-like quality of vitriol, extracted by the art of distillation, and mixed with some sulphur,

for the vitriol itself <consists of> much alum, some verdigris, and a little sulphur, however, the aluminous water [..] in the mines, and picks up the qualities of <marchos> (=marcasites?), and, united with the sulphur in the marcasite, it grows gradually, or is boiled till it is thick. When distilled, however, so much aluminous and sulphureous fumes ascend, while the aeruginous quality is left in the bottom of the retort, whence this oil will have an aluminous, and not aeruginous, taste.

This oil is however crude, and consists of a mixture of mild and sharp, that is, much alum and some sulphur; the mild however consists of sulphur only; for it is nothing but liquid sulphur extracted from the crude oil, which is why its taste doesn't resemble alum, but sulphur. Either one should however be made with the utmost diligency, with a suitable furnace, retort, and receptacle; it is (as the chemists say) the quality of the instruments

Distribution of vitriol
since there are several vitriols, it is useful to establish what kinds to use for this operation, and even if all vitriol will yield this oil, none of these is better than the blue or green, since these <contain> much volatile <sulphur> (acc. to Valerius Cordus), whereby the ascension of the oil is facilitated. It should also be noted, that better than manufactured vitriol would be the natural,

On the signs of infection
I say, in accordance with certain experts, that the infected are recognised by colour, respiratory distress, pulse, urine and blood. Colour: at the beginning of the infection, they have a very bright, rosy colour, more so than usual, and later, as the head has expelled the <pestiferous> matter, the colour fades. Respiratory distress: to breathe out

is more heavy than to breathe in. Pulse: the pulse is now strong, now weak; now slow, now fast; now distinct, now vague. Urine: the common signs, relevant in this respect, that I have noticed, were clouds in the urine, which at times contained hydropic fluid and sediment at the bottom of the urine <vial>; in the middle or upper parts, such clouds contained sediment at the bottom; then the infected will not last (A little unclear/UÖ)

if in the middle part, then it is the beginning of the infection, and is much more easily cured. If in the upper part, then I noticed that the human was totally infected, since Egidius says that equal likes equal [..].

Afterwards, add one sextary of malmsey. Boil by bain-marie in a well stopped tin pot. When an egg can be fried [..], take it out, and let it cool, and this is to be regarded as the best in cataract, and well tried, even by a nobleman in Bautzen,

Fainting donkeys
I won't keep quiet about something that Plutarch didn't want to keep quiet about. ”What's that?” you say: that donkeys and horses, who, as beasts of burden, carry figs, do faint.

and humans, all but killed by fainting, will be revived by bread: for when they have swallowed a mere morsel of this, they immediately are strengthened by this food, and resume their trip.

This is to be thoroughly mixed; thus cracks in stones can be joined. When this has been done, take equal parts of liquid varnish and linseed oil, which are mixed over fire. When they have been united, the surface <of the stone> is smeared. From a handwritten book.

Removing spots on white and kermes-dyed silk.
First, the spots are moistened with thrice distilled wine spirit, then egg-white is added. <The cloth> is dried in the sun, and rinsed thoroughly in cold water; after this has been done twice, the spots are gone.

To make black spots on white furs, so they look like leopard or panther skin
Take one ounce of litharge; two ounces of quicklime; three measures of water. These are mixed and put over slow fire until warm only, but not boiling. Then they are removed from the fire and mixed, and this will produce a dye, with which, using a small brush made from pigs' bristles, spots are sprinkled. Afterwards, they are dried in the sun.

Then they are thoroughly beaten with a rod of some kind, and it is done. But if the spots can not be seen very well, the same spots should be dyed again, and your desire should be fulfilled; this colour will last, and render the skins fragrant (or 'smelly'). If hair or beard is dyed, they will look very good.

How to make vanishing letters visible, and how to make visible letters vanish.
If you would want vanishing letters to be seen, and visible letters to vanish, you can do that, if you pour liquid from distillation of vitriol, or alcohol, over the paper until it is soaked; you then write your letters, and when they dry, they are hidden. Then, you grind a burnt stick with vinegar,

and write what we want between the lines of the former writing. Then a decoction is made, of must of unripe grapes in white wine, a sponge is soaked in this, and when we dab the writing, our homemade black colour vanishes, but the former, invisible, will now be visible (an approximation of the contents, since the text is a bit unclear/UÖ)

How the human intellect flies when considering the secrets of nature! Fine filings of steel are submersed in three times its weight of aquafortis (probably = nitric acid/UÖ), to which then is added soot of liquid tar or turpentine, to make it darker, and you cover the vessel. Then you grind it well on a porphyry slab; then write, and with age, it will vanish. I cannot omit, that the most important, the main thing, is to try this <frequently>,

for if the writing remains to long some more aquafortis should be added, and if you have been careful, no yellow-ish traces will remain. This is the sign you might use. Thus you can have another, of a similar kind, if you needed to hide things better: (here should follow another recipe/UÖ)

the letters are, so the stone is bare; then keep the stone in very strong vinegar for seven hours, and then remove it; if it is immersed for a longer time, the crust will fall off faster, for what happens is almost like what happens in the human body when so called escharotic remedies are adhibited; the time spent in the vinegar – and the amount of vinegar – will render the substance more powerful. Thus it will penetrate, whence the stone must needs be diminished. It is obvious, however, that this method could also be transferred to other stones,

Powder to wipe off black spots, like letters written on paper.
Take thoroughly ground ceruse and fig milk, as much as is needed of each. When you wish to remove black <stains> or letters from a paper, take a linen cloth moistened with water, (some text has been omitted by the writer here/UÖ) and if the black is not altogether removed, repeat; and it can't happen, but if the paper is too weakened, by rubbing with the kind of glue that is used to join wood (something must be missing after this/UÖ)

How weights are lifted twice as fast, and with half as much rope
This is a wonderful apparatus, which however is brought about with little work. Gabriel Arator noticed that it was possible that weights be lifted twice as fast as by the usual method, in this way. Let the height be a,b, the middle of which is d, and attach to the rope d,c, a weight c, and in d, a pulley, where the rope in a.[---] When, thus, the pulley is drawn to e,

d,c, will be shortened twice as much, thus when d, is at a, c, will also be at a. This, however, happens since c,d, is doubled in ascending and descending, thus non converges unless d, is right between a,b, or lower; this apparatus will however possess greater power than if the weight was simply lifted. Since, for the reasons given, this lift can be made easier, it is possible that it will also be lifted in half the time with the same strength. So much can art and ingeniousness achieve. (A drawing, as well as parts of the description, is missing here; furthermore, I'm no scientist, so I don't know whether this makes sense/UÖ)

The property of ellebore

The elleborus niger is called herba salvatoris by the distillers, since it liberates the humans from all sickness that is brought about by phlegmatic and melancholic fluids; it removes the thick fluids from all parts of the body; it gives good colour …, and it makes the flesh smooth and even. And because of this, it is given for cancer, for bites, and for moles of the skin. Only the exterior part of the root should be given, and not the core, because that part causes flatulence, vomiting and colic of the intestines. Do not give it mixed with other solutives, for it is very potent. For the same reason it is quite conveniently [used], but two scruples of peel from the root, taken as a powder, contained in wafer, will be enough, as otherwise, because of the bitterness, they cannot take it. They keep the human young and healthy for a long time; they can … the pains from gout and arthritis, … if an extract is made with alcohol,
